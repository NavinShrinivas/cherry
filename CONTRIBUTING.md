## Pick up an issue 

- Go through the issue and see what suits you. Just asking to be assigned does not work (You will get seen zoned). You need to do your due-diligence and propose and solution to be assigned. 

- If an issue seems stale (no progress for quite a while), you can also propose your solution and ask to be re-assgined. Try and discuss with the previously assigned person to find out what went wrong and try to solve it in the proposed solution.

## Submitting a PR 

- Try and keep code quality/pattern same as rest of the code base. If it is different, reason with some maintainer as to why it is different. 

- Write test, WRITE test. Even simple tests may suffice. Your PR won't be merged unless you give the maintainer confidence of its correctness. 

- Make sure you don't break any existing test. PRs breaking existing test are automatically rejected. If you find an error in already existing code/logic/test. Mention it in the issue (can be the reason why your tests are failing) and you can even get extra bounties!
